Build a professional demo college website named Riverview College of Arts & Science. It should look realistic and polished like a real institution’s site.

General Rules:

The website should have 4 pages only:

Home (index.html)

About Us (about.html)

Academics (academics.html)

Admissions (admissions.html)

Each page must have its own CSS file (e.g., style.css, about.css, academics.css, admissions.css).

The theme and main styles (colors, fonts, navbar design, footer style) should stay the same across all pages for consistency.

The navbar must be identical on every page, with the correct link highlighted (active) depending on which page is open.

The website should be responsive and clean, with sections styled neatly (using grid or flex where appropriate).

Do not add extra pages beyond these four.
